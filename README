thumbify.py: simple thumbnailing + face detection

thumbify.py crops and scales images square so that they
may be used as thumbnails. It will attempt to recognize
if the image(s) contain any faces, and attempt to avoid
cropping them. It will then try to identify and remove
the least interesting parts of the image first.

deface.py identifies suspected faces in an image and
prints out their bounding box.

OpenCV with the development headers is requied. You
may need edit the path to the Haar classifier cascade
file in deface.py if you get an error message complaining
"terminate called after throwing an instance of 'int'".

Enjoy!
