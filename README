thumbify.py: simple thumbnailing + face detection

thumbify.py crops and scales images square so that they
may be used as thumbnails. It will attempt to recognize
if the image(s) contain any faces, and attempt to avoid
cropping them. It will then try to identify and remove
the least interesting parts of the image first.

deface.py identifies suspected faces in an image and
prints out their bounding box.

To install dependencies on Ubuntu:

apt-get install python-opencv python-numpy libopencv-dev python-pyexiv2
